Use this file as a guide for inserting items into the database.

~ Setting Credentials ~
1. Open the databaseConfig.example.js file. Resave it in the same directory with the name databaseConfig.js.
2. Add the credentials for your database.
3. In database.js, change line 2 to be this new file (databaseConfig.js).

~ Preparing the Database File ~
1. In, database.js, remove the semicolon from line 126.
2. Uncomment lines 129-135.


~ Preparing the Server ~
1. Navigate to server/server.js and open in a text editor.

  If you're adding users to the database:
    2. Uncomment lines 53-90.
    3. Change line 60 to the directory and file which stores your Hacker News API data for users.

  If you're adding items (stories, comments, etc.) to the database:
    2. Uncomment lines 96-166.
    3. Change line 107 to the directory and file which stores your Hacker News API data.

~ Preparing Your Data Files ~
1. Remove the last new line character from the .txt file you are inserting into the database. There should be no empty lines.

~ Power Settings for Your Computer ~
1. Plug your computer into a charger.
2. Click the ï£¿ in the upper left bar on your home screen.
3. Select system preferences.
4. Select energy saver.
5. Check:
  * Prevent computer from sleeping automatically when the display is off.
  * Wake for Wi-Fi network access.
  * Kindly close pop-ups that warn you you're going to waste power.
6. Uncheck:
  * Put hard disks to sleep when possible.
  * Enable Power Nap while plugged into a power adapter.

~ Running the Process ~
1. In the terminal, run app.js from the main Scheming-Lion directory: node --max-old-space-size=8192 app.js

WARNING: This next step will use all of your computer's resources (dedicating 8GB of RAM to your server). Do not expect to complete work side-by-side while inserting items.

2. Open a browser. Type 'http://localhost:1337/populateUsers' or 'http://localhost:1337/importData' depending on your task.
  - Your terminal (not console) will let you know that the MySQL inserts are happening.
    The first consoles to the terminal may take a while, because the app
    is sorting each of the lines by type ('story', 'comment', etc.).
  - If you see Sequelize constraint errors, it is preventing duplicates from being entered into the db.
  - It takes roughly 30 minutes to insert a file with 700,000 lines.
