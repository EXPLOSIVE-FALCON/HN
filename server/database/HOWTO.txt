Use this file as a guide for inserting items into the database.

1. Navigate to server/server.js and open in a text editor
2. Uncomment lines 48-118
  -We don't want production server to see these, but we want to use them internally
3. Change line 59 to the directory and file which stores your Hacker News API data
  -This will likely be in the scraper_data folder of the Scraper repository
4. Remove the last new line character from the .txt file you are inserting into the database. There should be no empty lines
5. In the terminal, run app.js from the main Scheming-Lion directory: ```node --max-old-space-size=8192 app.js```
